# Dataset
Big dataset release! Check out my flashy <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mauricett/lichess_sf">HuggingFace dataset</a>!

# Status
Still migrating the code to new dataset. Already ran a couple of neural net training runs and found some fantastic architectures that look very promising. Will update with more details in the following days. Currently trying to reproduce my experiments with the Leela codebase.

# Feedback and discussions
I'm happy about any feedback or discussion. Feel free to reach out.
